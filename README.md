# COSC 329 - Assignment #4

There are two main files to be aware of when running the project. `plot_help_graphs.m` and `plot_both_graphs.m`. The first file does everything required to plot the graphs specified in the assignment for the `NeedHelp` DBN. The second file combines the two DBNs and plots them on the same graph based on the conditions in the assignment. `install_bnt.m` is used to install BNT into matlab, when matlab is first started.

### CPTs

All CPTs with their respective value are in cpts.pdf. These CPTs values are used in the matlab script.

### Plots

All plots are saved in the repository, when running the files that plots the DBNs these files will be overwritten/updated.

### Running the Project

To run the project follow the steps below:
> 1. Ensure Matlab is running.
> 2. Ensure you are in the root directory of the project.
> 3. In Matlab run the `install_bnt.m` script.
> 4. In Matlab run the `plot_help_graphs.m` script to plot the first section of the assignment.
> 5. In Matlab run the `plot_both_graphs.m` script to plot the second section of the assignment.
